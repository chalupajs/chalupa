Chalupa is a high-level framework for microservices, with the goal of making it easier to write better software faster. Software that is easy to write, test and maintain.

## Features

* **TypeScript from the ground up.** Chalupa is written in TypeScript and facilitates the use of TypeScript throughout.
* **Decorator-based.** Just write simple TypeScript classes, interfaces and methods, and then decorate them with the appropriate Chalupa decorators. No manual wiring needed, everything is taken care of by the framework.
* **IoC container inside.** By wrapping [Inversify](https://inversify.io/), Chalupa provides an IoC container for your service, making things like Dependency Injection as easy as ever.
* **External service calls made visible.** Make external service dependencies visible, typable and mockable using Chalupa's `@ExternalService()` decorator. Say goodbye to messy, impossible-to-test remote calls!
* **Code reuse and modularity.** Want to create reusable components across services? Want to split a service into smaller units? Code reuse and modularity is explicitly supported and facilitated by Chalupa via so-called modules.
* **Configuration support.** Building on [konvenient](https://github.com/dwmt/konvenient), Chalupa lets you create services which are easily and transparently configurable via environment variables and configuration files.
